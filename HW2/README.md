# Week 2 Project
## This weeks homework assignment was to solve a multilabel classification problem using end to end transfer learning. I chose to work on a dataset of plant images and entered into this kaggle competition. Link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7/overview 
#### At the end of it all, I was able to obtain a very high accuracy of around 96 percent and a public score of .949 placing me in the top 60% on the public leaderboard and 67% on the private leaderboard.
#### This project was also my capstone project for the Udacity Machine Learning engineering Nanodegree that I have been working hard on for the past 6 months or so.
